# Go Go Googles GBA

Deep in the woods of a magical forest, there is an enchanted tree that grows beautiful and valuable flowers. On your quest to obtain them, you find the tree, but its flowers are much too tall for your reach. They grow rapidly, but to get them, you’ll have to jump! Be careful— once the butterflies start to take note of what you’re attempting, they’ll swarm to it… You’ll have to knock them down before things get too crowded, or the tree may lose all its magic! If you reach your goal without the butterflies getting in the way, you can return home safely, flowers in tow.

-Butterflies are sometimes too high (player cannot reach) or too low (hidden partially in the ground).
